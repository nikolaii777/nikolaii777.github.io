      Explain how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
      people
    </h3>

    <p class="pue">
      I think learning new things ie Coding, Riding a bike or even trying to play
      an instrument, it's important to remember that Neuroplasticity helps grow
      the brain and lets it exercise completing this over and over like a new
      muscle! this then muscle hardens and makes it easier to perform this
      easier in the future
    </p>

    <h3 class="neuro">
      how might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own
      benefit
    </h3>

    Engaging with neuroplasticity for my own benefit increases my ability to
    understand growth through thinking about something that I can't see
    physically and learning more about how I understand things.

    <h3 class="neuro">
      What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity
    </h3>

    <ul class="lolist">
      <li>Good quality sleep</li>
      <li>Exercise</li>
      <li>Reduce stress</li>
      <li>Meditate</li>
      <li>Learn something new,</li>
    </ul>

    </h3>

    <p class="pue">
      Yeah a few things! I never understood the meaning of neuroplasticity And
      what it meant to practise and exercise that
    </p>

    <h3 class="neuro">
      How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
    </h3>

    <p class="pue">
      I will approach exercises with a more positive attitude and less of an I
      cant do it!” And I’m dumb and I dont know what I’m doing here! I believe I
      have already learnt so much about myself that I didn't think I was capable
      of.
