   <h1>Learning Development Plan</h1>
   <p>
       <b>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</b>
       My long term goal is to be able to work with my community in a tech capacity. My goal going into this course was to be able to design and create apps for my culture and sustain the sharing of Niuean culture for generations. I would also like to help other with tech tools from a similar background to me.
       What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
       The ability to effectively communicate in person and written. Writing is something I really struggle with and has been the biggest challenge already in this course, so it is the biggest thing I want to try and become less anxious about. I would like to develop my ability to have hard conversations with ease and productively. I would also like to improve my time management and self directed working style i.e. effective project planning.

       <b>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</b>
       I’m aware that I have a tendency to become avoidant, and procrastinate when I find things difficult or my self doubt creeps in. I was aware of this pattern coming in to this course and have set up various things to help me manage this. By tapping into my people skills I have created a supportive network of peers outside of dev to go to for guidance or reassurance when I start to doubt myself or I get stuck on things. I have also created a group chat on Slack with other Pasifika and Māori students to talk to each other and find support. I think these things will keep me on track and motivated.
       A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
       I will, and have already been seeking help from other students, past students and friends who are developers. I have been contacting them via slack, and coming in to school to talk kanohi ki te kanohi.
       <b>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</b>
       I expect them to be open to assisting, and forwardly clear about their boundaries and limitations for assistance. I expect them to be empathetic and appreciative that this is a new learning environment for me which can sometimes feel unwelcoming and scary.
       <b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</b>
       I don’t have any block out times where I am committed to other things, I have already ended my projects and other work. The only commitment I have for the next ten weeks from 22 July is a weekly Kura Pō class on Mondays from 7-9pm. I would like to have at least one free day from coding or commuting to school, to spend time with friends and family.
