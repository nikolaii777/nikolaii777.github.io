            <b class="titlecl">What are classes?</b> <br/>
            Classes are selectors that help html elements 
            to be styled. 
            By giving a html a class name you then would be telling 
            that element to be styled with css. Below are images of how I used classes 
            to style all of my list together <br/>
            <img class="row" src="IMAGES/CLASS-HTML.png" alt="class html example">
            <img class="row" src="IMAGES/CLASS-CSS.png"  alt="class css example">
            <img class="row" src="IMAGES/CLASS-BLOG.png" alt="class css execution">

            <b class="titlecl">Difference between id & classes </b>
            They dont have a huge difference between them but id 
            tags only talk to one element at a time where as classes 
            talk to multiple you would use an id tag on something you 
            would use once like a header or a logo etc. 
            Images below show 
            how I changed applied css only to my id.
