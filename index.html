    <h3 class="aboutme">About Me</h3> 
  <p>Hi everyone my name is Nikolai, I’m an Aries and I live in Pt Chev with my partner and cat called Puppy lol

    Recently I’ve been thinking about my family and personal relationships and how much value I give them in my life. My brother was born in February and lives in Niue with my mum, so my mind has been in two countries since then. I’m also thinking about the close network of people in my life because I invest a lot of time and energy in them all. People are really important to me.
    
    I wanted to go to Dev Academy because there is a shortage of Pasifika people in the tech industry. I was hesitant to come to Dev because I didn’t think I was smart enough, I didn’t have the best time in the school system, but I’m enjoying Dev so far and have already met some friendly faces!</p>
