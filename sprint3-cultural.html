    <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1> 
<p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to monitor your own and other people's emotions.</p>

<h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1> 
<p>IQ also known as intelligence Quotient indicates a person's intelligence 
level. People with EQ tend to have better social skills OR what I call it 
while djing “reading the room”</p>
<h1>Why is it important?</h1>
<p>Unlike your IQ, which remains stable during your life, 
emotional intelligence continues to grow and can help understand your 
everyday learning environments! Self Awareness, Self Regulation and 
Empathy these are really good tools to have inside and outside workplaces.</p>
