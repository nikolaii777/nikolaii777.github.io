    <h3 class="analogy">HTML and CSS meet JavaScript</h3>
   
    <p class="colorana">
    
      An analogy to describe the difference between HTML and CSS
    HTML holds the structure and textual content of a web page and 
    CSS provides the 
    instructions on its style and appearance. 
    For example, the HTML could include headings, subheadings 
    and paragraph text; and the CSS allows us to apply 
    a different colour or font to that text.
    your car may be used as an analogy for the differences between HTML and CSS.
    The “Car” would be HTML and the “Gas” would represent CSS 
    “Gas” is used as the content filling in this structure “Car”.
    Similarly, HTML holds the content and structure of a web page

    <h3 class="analogy">Control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
    
    <p class="colorana">
    Control flow is about the order a computer executes what you ask it to do using coding languages. 
    Generally, computer instructions are carried out from top to bottom. However, 
    looping statements such as for, while and do-while, can require a computer to 
    disrupt a default top down flow.
    </p>
    
    
    The process of filling your car is a process that can be compared to control flow and looping.
    <ul>
    <li>Go to Gas station</li>
    <li>Fill the Tank</li>
    <li>Tank is filled</li>
    <li>if the amount is less than x, return to step 1</li>
    <li>else, Drives away in car.</li>
    </ul>
    
  
    <h3 class="analogy">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h3>
    
    <p class="colorana">The Document Object Model (DOM) is the browser's understanding and representation of an HTML document. 
    The DOM enables JavaScript to be used to access the HTML as an object and change the HTML elements of a web page; 
    allowing us to make more dynamic and interactive websites. You can interact with the DOM by opening developer tools in the browser and 
    navigating to the 'elements' section, this is the DOM.</p>
    
    <h3 class="analogy" >Explain the difference between accessing 
    data from arrays and objects</h3>
    
    Objects are variables that can contain multiple items (values, properties, methods / functions). 
    You can access these things inside the objects by using the name of the property or method like so:
    
    <ul>
    <li>objectName.propertyName</li>
    <li>objectName["propertyName"]</li>
    <li>objectName.methodName() </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="colorana">Arrays can store multiple items (elements) under a single label (variable) too. However, 
    the items in an array are accessed or 'called' using an automatically given index 
    number starting from 0. To access an array item you may use the
    variable followed by the index number in brackets e.g. arrayName[0] will 
    access the first item of the array.</p>
    
    <h3 class="analogy">Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h3>
    
    <p class="colorana">A function is a set of instructions / a customised JavaScript command created to carry out 
    a particular action. Helpfully, the Watch and Code Practical JavaScript course describes 
    functions as 'recipes'. The basic structure of a function is as follows:
  </p>
    
  <br>
  function nameOfFunction(parameters) { <br>
    instructions; <br>
    } <br>
    To run a function:<br>
    nameOfFunction()
    
    <p class="colorana">A function can be defined once and reused many times
    this helps us to avoid 
    repeating ourselves again and again and again. 
  </p>
